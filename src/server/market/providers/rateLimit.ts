// Request pacing for the cTrader feed.
//
// Two independent limits are enforced here, both measured against the live
// endpoint rather than assumed:
//
//   1. Concurrency. cTrader answers BLOCKED_PAYLOAD_TYPE / "You are being rate
//      limited" once more than FIVE ProtoOAGetTrendbarsReq requests are in
//      flight on one socket. Measured: 4 concurrent -> all OK; 8 -> 5 OK and 3
//      blocked; 12 -> 5 OK and 7 blocked. So the ceiling is enforced with a
//      semaphore at MAX_IN_FLIGHT, below the observed limit on purpose.
//   2. Rate. The same volume spaced out is fine: 12 requests at 250ms apart
//      completed in 4.0s with nothing blocked. So a small token bucket keeps a
//      re-run from tripping the limit again immediately.
//
// An earlier version allowed one request per 1.2s and, worse, multiplied the
// wait by the queue length, so a 7-symbol sweep took 6.9s even though the broker
// answers in about 65ms. Nothing here needs to be that slow.
//
// Binance is governed by a published weight budget rather than a socket
// ceiling: 1200 per minute per IP, with each klines request costing 2. The
// policy below is far inside that, and exists mainly to stop a runaway loop
// from being rude rather than to avoid being throttled.
